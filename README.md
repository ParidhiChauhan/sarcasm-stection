Project: Cross Cultural Sarcasm Detection using transformer models
Description:This project aims to detect sarcasm in text using Machine Learning (ML) and NLP techniques. Sarcasm detection is a challenging task in sentiment analysis because sarcastic statements often have different meanings than their literal words suggest. The project processes textual data, extracts relevant features, and trains a model to classify sentences as sarcastic or non-sarcastic.

Key Features:
✅ Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.
✅ Feature Engineering: TF-IDF, word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), and sentiment analysis.
✅ Model Training: Machine Learning models (SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) and Deep Learning (LSTMs, Transformers).
✅ Evaluation: Accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall metrics.
✅ Deployment: Possible integration into an API or web application for real-time sarcasm detection.

Technology Stack:
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras)
NLP Libraries (NLTK, SpaCy)
Deep Learning Frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab for experimentation
GitHub for version control
